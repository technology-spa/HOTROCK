# Introduction 
 
First off, thank you for considering contributing to HOTROCK. It's people like you that make HOTROCK such a great tool. 
 
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue(s), assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. 
 
HOTROCK is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests. At this time, we are not ready to accept contributions of written code which can be incorporated into HOTROCK itself, but we will in the future. 
 
Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions.  

## Ground Rules 
 
### Responsibilities 
 
Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted.  
 
Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this [checklist:](../master/pull_request_checklist.md) 
 
Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback. 
 
Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version. 
 
Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.  
 
## Your First Contribution 
 
Unsure where to begin contributing to HOTROCK? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: 
 
*Beginner issues* - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two. 
 
*Help wanted issues* - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 
 
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have. 
 
 
Here are two good links to resources for people who have never contributed to open source before.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). 
 
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge. 
 
## Getting started 
 
### A quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution. 
 

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix: 
 
1. Create your own fork of the code 
2. Do the changes in your fork 
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it: 
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. 
    * Sign the [Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)](../Individual_Contributor_License_Agreement) and the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](../master/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin.md) 
    * Note the [HOTROCK Code of Conduct.](../Code_of_Conduct) 
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a ICLA on file. 
 
 
Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a ICLA. 
 
As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following: 
 
* Spelling / grammar fixes 
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes 
* Comment clean up 
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants 
* Adding logging messages or debugging output 
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc. 
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another 

## How to report a bug 
 
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Any security issues should be submitted directly to [hotrocker@technologyspa.com] instead. 
 
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions: 
 
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to? 
* Can I disable something for other people? 
 
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at [hotrocker@technologyspa.com]. 
 
 
## How to file a bug report 
 
When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions: 
 
1. What version of **'[any key components]'** are you using? 
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using? 
3. What did you do? 
4. What did you expect to see? 
5. What did you see instead? 
 
General questions should go to the HOTROCK mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The team there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug. 
 
 
## How to suggest a feature or enhancement 
 
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in HOTROCK, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that HOTROCK has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. 
 
 
## Code review process 
 
The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a monthly triage meeting that we hold in a public Google Hangout. The hangout is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the HOTROCK-dev list. Notes are posted to the HOTROCK **Community community-triage repo and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. THIS ISNT REAL YET**
 
After feedback has been given, we expect responses within three weeks. After three weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity. 
 
## Community 
_If there are other channels you use besides GitHub to discuss contributions, mention them here. You can also list the author, maintainers, and/or contributors here, or set expectations for response time. **WE NEED TO DECIDE THIS CHANNEL SET**_
